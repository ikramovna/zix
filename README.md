# ZIXX Project Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide provides detailed instructions on setting up the ZIXX project, a Django-based application designed for managing construction materials efficiently.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended for environment isolation)

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the ZIXX repository from GitHub to your local machine using the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikramovna/zix.git
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)
Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies from other Python projects. Run the following command:
```bash
python -m venv zixx-env
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment using the appropriate command for your operating system:
- **Windows**: `.\zixx-env\Scripts\activate`
- **macOS/Linux**: `source zixx-env/bin/activate`
- You should see the virtual environment name in the terminal prompt.
- To deactivate the virtual environment, run the command `deactivate`.
- If you are not using a virtual environment, skip this step.
- If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before proceeding to the next steps.

### 4. Install Required Packages
Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Set Up the Database
Create the database tables by running the following commands:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Create a Superuser
Create a superuser account to access the Django admin interface:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 7. Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server using the command:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
